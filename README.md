# Project Title

This is the Project 3 DeFi Yield Staking and Loans Dapp.  We allow users to deposit Tether Tokens and we give them a reward
based on how much they deposit divided by 5 (StakeBalance/5 or 20% return).  One can deposit a maximum of 100 tokens, and earn a maximum reward of 100/5 = 20 tokens. Once the user hits withdraw, all the money is taken out at once.

Smart Contract description and logic/functions used within the contract:
Tether.sol and RWD.sol: These are the smart contracts that create the two coins we use in this project. Tether is the coin that the client uses to deposit in our bank.  RWD is the reward token or coin that we give the client for depositing their Tether with us.  If we were to expand this in theory we could create a smart contract for any major cryptocurrency that we feel we could realistically profit from.  We could also in the future decide to reward clients with real cryptocurrency versus our own reward token.

The main functions we make use of are the transfer() and approve() functions in both contracts.  The transfer function 
requires that the sender's be larger than 0, and then the function subtracts the amount to from the sender's balance, and adds the amount sent to the receiver's balance.  The approve function is important in case anyone wants to send coin to anyone else besides the 'central bank'. This function allows that transfer to take place.

DecentralBank.sol: This smart contract is really the brains behind the yield staking aspect of this project.  We have two 
functions that control the deposit and withdrawing, and those functions are depositTokens() and unstakeTokens(), respectively. DepositTokens() makes a call to the transfer function from the Tether smart contract, and unstakeTokens() makes a call to the transfer function as well, but with the amounts and sender/receivers reversed.

The issueTokens() function is the function that does the rewarding of our mock reward token to the client.  In the javascript file Airdrop.js we have logic that if the amount deposited is greater than or equal to 50, we reward the tokens. For simplicity we just make the reward the amount deposited divided by 5, or 20% of the deposited amount. If we had more time we would want to investigate more closely how to import math libraries and do continuous compounding at a healthy interest rate to do the rewarding of tokens.

The Migrations.sol smart contract was mostly autogenerated for us when we first initiated the project in the truffle suite with the command 'truffle init'.  We only updated the pragma compiler version to be > 0.5.0 and added a constructor function
to make the owner equal to msg.sender.

Please see videos showing a demo of a Deposit, an issuance of reward tokens, and a withdrawal.

The second and more important part of the project is the Loan business part of the DeFi bank.



## Technologies and Installation Guide

For the yield staking part of the project you must do the following:

We have python version 3.7.10 and git version 2.33.0.windows.2 installed on a laptop running windows 10 pro. We also have MetaMask and Ganache installed.

Install node.js to be able to run javascript from the command line. Run 'node -v' after install to ensure you get a version number. Install truffle suite to be able to compile and migrate contracts to the blockchain using one of the address you get when launching Ganache. You can run 'npm install -g truffle' (the g here is global so it hits all your environments).

Now for the loans part of the project!

DeFiBankAccountModel documentation & direction for button operation

This instance of LoanModel functions as a standard contract between the Bank and patron.
Memory: Data will only be stored during the execution of the function.
Storage: the data will persist even after the function executes.
Favorite Number will start off as zero.
Deploy
addPerson: “Patrick”, 2
Click addPerson button.
In the “people” button, put 0, then click the button and you should get
0: uint256: accountNumber 2
1: string: name Patrick
This means at the 0th index in this people array, we’ll get string Patrick.
The next person that you put in will be at “people” button, 1.  Remember to add and click the people button before you put in 1 and click “people”.
nameToAccount button - put in “Becca”, click the button, and you’ll see what her account number pops up as.
Connect to InjectedWeb3 to run test transactions on your test ethereum account.
Redeploy the contract, hit confirm on the metamask pop up, and you will see the contract pop up on the ganache webpage.
Let’s say that you put 123 in the store button, meta mask will pop up and the transaction will appear to store the information, and the retrieve function will show 123.  In this sense, ‘store’ and ‘retrieve’ are linked to each other and later used for inheritance for the DeFiBankStorageFactory.sol file, where as ‘addPerson’, ‘nameToAccountNumber’, ‘accountNumber’, and ‘people’ are buttons that interact with each other. 
The below images show the creation of the contract and its history on the ganache block chain.

DeFiBankStorageFactory documentation & direction for button operation

Create LoanModel Contract by hitting the createLoanModel contract button.  By doing this, I create a new transaction that’s going to create a new Loan Model contract and push it onto our StorageFactory array.
If you were to put 0 in the loanModelArray, you’d get the address for the newly created contract on the array.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90321433/156670099-7532910e-8c1d-4197-8e07-bdc7badd305a.png)

For the sfStore button, first create the contract, and then on the sfStore button enter in 0.  0 is the array that the contract from LoanModel exists on.
On loanModelArray, enter 0, click the button, and the account number from LoanModel will pop up.
On sfGet, enter 0, click the button, and you will get a return of how many contracts exist on that array.
The following screenshot displays this information:

Looking at inheritance.  StorageFactory now has all the buttons that Loan Model has in addition to the original buttons Storage Factory possessed:

Keep in mind that StorageFactory is keeping record of the instances on LoanModel, so if you work and deploy on LoanModel, it will be seen in StorageFactory.  For this demo of inheritance, we have one contract deployed on the 0 Array for LoanModel as is seen on StorageFactory.


DeFiBankLoanContract documentation & direction for button operation

This instance of a loan model works as a classic loan contract between the Bank and patron.
Before, we haven’t been working with value, with this demo we will be working with wei.
Let’s first work with the ‘fund’ button.  Deploy the contract, enter in 1000000000 wei, enter in the address of the account the money will be given to, and click ‘addressToAmountGiven’, and you’ll see this transaction happen:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90321433/156671425-ed1c5e59-7b0b-47fb-8464-ab52dc295ba5.png)

 Because Tether is the equivalent of the US Dollar, if you see 1 Dollar, then it’s 1 Tether.If we want to check the current value of Tether, we can simply click the button and it will return the value:

On a technical note, people can come in and subscribe to a contract for the purpose of potentially purchasing the loan from the bank in the future.  This is accomplished with this code here:

And people subscribed to the contract will be (for example) able to see the following transaction history:

## Usage

Open the command prompt and go to the directory where your code sits.  This is to run the yield staking part of the project.

I) Compile the contracts by running 'truffle compile'
II) Migrate the contracts to the blockchain by running 'truffle migrate --reset'
III) Launch the webpage that runs the front-end by running 'npm start'
IV) Deposit some money and enjoy getting rich!
